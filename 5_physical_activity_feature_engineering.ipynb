    "In the context of the given code, `minsb_days_vector` holds the number of sedentary minutes for each day, and `valid_wear_minutes` represents the total valid wear time (in minutes) for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's imagine a real-life scenario to help illustrate the concept of the weighted average:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: Imagine three days of activity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Day 1**: The subject was sedentary for 30 minutes, but the valid wear time was only 60 minutes.\n",
    "2. **Day 2**: The subject was sedentary for 240 minutes (4 hours), but the valid wear time was 480 minutes (8 hours).\n",
    "3. **Day 3**: The subject was sedentary for 60 minutes, and the valid wear time was 120 minutes (2 hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we calculate a simple average of sedentary minutes, we'd get: \\( \\frac{30 + 240 + 60}{3} = 110 \\) minutes, which means, on average, the person was sedentary for 110 minutes each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this doesn't account for the varying lengths of valid wear time each day. It treats a sedentary minute on a day where the device was only worn for 1 hour as equal to a sedentary minute on a day where it was worn for 8 hours. In reality, the day with 8 hours of wear time provides more information and should carry more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a weighted average, we're saying: \"Given the amount of time the device was validly worn each day, how many minutes was the person, on average, sedentary?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example:\n",
    "- Day 1 has a \"weight\" of 60 minutes.\n",
    "- Day 2 has a \"weight\" of 480 minutes.\n",
    "- Day 3 has a \"weight\" of 120 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weighted average will prioritize Day 2's sedentary minutes more than Day 1's because the device was worn for a longer time on Day 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuitive Meaning**: The weighted average in this context essentially provides an average of sedentary minutes that is adjusted for the amount of time the device was validly worn each day. It gives us a more representative measure of sedentary behavior by accounting for the varying \"confidence\" or \"reliability\" of each day's data, as determined by wear time."
