    "**¡¡IMPORTANT!!**: In notebook \"9_split_dataset.ipynb\", we found that from the 2897 subjects with BMD data, 328 had no accelerometer data and were excluded. This left us with 2569 subjects. Please note that this exclusion was based on the accelerometer data used in the baseline classification approach (pax.csv), not on the accelerometer data used in the deep learning approach (time series matrix). Specifically, the exclusion was based on dropping those subjects that had a NaN at the variable PAXMINSB (df=df.dropna(subset=['PAXMINSB'])). PAXMINSB was one of the variable'engineered' in notebook \"5_physical_activity_feature_engineering.ipynb\", and in there *we didn't exclude those who did not have a complete week of data*, as we did in notebook \"6_generate_time_series_matrix.ipynb\". Instead, we processed all minutes that had been flagged as 'valid' by NHANES and did a weighted average. That's why we have 7776 subjects in pax.csv and 7537 subjects in the time series matrix.\n",
    "Therefore, *we did not apply the same exclusion criteria for accelerometer data (used in the baseline_classification) as we did for the time series matrix (used in the deep learning approach)*. And the problem is that the training and tests sets were split based on the subjects in pax.csv, not in the time series matrix. Thus, we have some subjects in the training and test sets that do not have a complete week of data in the time series matrix, and therefore will not be there when we want to train the deep learning model.
