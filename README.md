- Todo

# Environment

We use a [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) environment. 

## First time setup

1. Install poetry if you haven't already
2. Navigate to this project's directory in your terminal and run `poetry install`
3. Activate the environment in the terminal with `poetry shell` (you have to be in the project's directory)
4. Make this environment showable as an option when selecting jupyter kernels: `ipython kernel install --user --name <name-of-env> --display-name "<display_name>"`

Now this kernel will show up as an option in your jupyter notebooks.
